This project is a library of games that are played in your terminal.

See the screenshot folder to see what the games look like.

There are 3 different playable games: Chess, Checkers, and Aggravation.
Also included is an option for Sorry; however, this one only displays the
Sorry board and is not fully playable.

To compile and run this project, you can simply use the command 'make run'. 
This command also works if you have already compiled.

If you want to see what's going on with the creation of the library, remove
the .a file and you can use the command 'make library'.

If you only want to compile and not run, use the command 'make' or 'make main.exe'.
