Chase worked on creating graphics and game board logic for Sorry. However, was 
	unsuccessful in getting functionality past that of simply displaying a 
	board and being able to draw cards from a finite deck.

Lily got all of the files working appropriately with each other for a final
	product. She then created the actual *library* of games and updated
	the make file. She then spent a lot of time to create the presentation.
	She also created the readme.

Issues of the week were that Chase did not pull the updated files from Lily
	like he said he would and was editing out of date files. This made
	Lily need to go back and fix some things. He also didn't finish
	editing files until the day of presentations which meant everything
	Lily needed to do had to wait until the very last minute which she
	was unhappy about.
