Chase created the graphics for the Aggravation board. At the
	time of writing this, he is trying to implement the Sorry board
	graphics, however (as of the most recent update) there have been 
	some issues encountered with ncurses acting "weird". Should have 
	a working version up in time for the presentations.

Lily finished the game logic and got Aggravation implemented. 
	She ran into some issues with how the input file
	was original written and made updates to that. She
	made sure that there is still a function to
	implement Sorry in the future though.

The plan for next week is to possibly finish off Sorry and
	then turn our games into a game library. We also
	will need to make our presentation.
