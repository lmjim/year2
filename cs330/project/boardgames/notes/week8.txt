Due to weather, Chase did all of his week 8 work at the very end of week 7 in anticipation of not
	being able to contribute this week. During week 7 he only needed to start chess which
	would then be finished during week 8. Chase instead completed chess, including the
	complicated moves, on Sunday of week 7. Chase also notified Boyana and Lily of his
	situation on Thursday of week 8. Needless to say, Chase accomplished his week 8 goal.

Lily finished checkers this week. She did find and fix some bugs in the input file, namely after
	giving incorrect movement choices that same bad choice kept getting tested. She also ran
	into some issues with the board, but was still able to figure it out despite not being
	able to ask Chase (just delayed some of the work).

Issues of the week: Chase not having power/cell service. However, we both finished what we
	needed to.

The plan for week 9 is for Chase to make a board for aggravation during the beginning of the
	week and for Lily to implement (most of) the logic during the rest of the week.
