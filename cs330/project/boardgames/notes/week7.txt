Lily spent a lot of time reviewing and altering Chase's code. Chase originally thought that the 
	non-windowed ncurses funtions were compatible with his windowed functions. As Lily started to 
	make the game checkers, she learned that this was not true. She went through all of the input 
	files to change them to use a window. Lily also updated the input files to make function 
	calls to the differnt games' move valididty checker. Lily also wrote a main file to be used 
	by all of the games. Lily also wrote a Makefile to compile the various executables. 

Chase added a swap and move function for the board. He also added the index numbers along the side of 
	the board to be user friendly. Chase also pointed out that the input functions would need to 
	be passed a pointer to the board.He also prompted Lily to implement the calls to check for 
	validity. 

Chase had a lot of issues with git this week, and Lily got frustrated with the code Chase pushed last week. 

The plan for next week is to finish implementing chess and checker to the best of our abilities.  

Feb. 24, 2019:
Chase finished chess, however there is apparently a problem when running it on ix-dev, as the board does not render
	even remotely correct, however on local environments is appears to work. Will ask Boyanna if this is a problem
	on our end or if it is on ix-dev. None-the-less, chess is implemented with 2 players, including all standard
	moves including en passant and castling.
