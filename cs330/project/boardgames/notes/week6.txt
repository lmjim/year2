This week our focus was to create a basis for our games. This includes getting input from the user and 
	having a game board displayed. Most of our time was spent learning how to even use ncurses. 



Chase accomplished making a chess board (which will be used for other games in addition to chess). Instead
	of implementing a board like we did with Othello, he created a background that looks like a chess board
	that we can place pieces on. Changing colors presented challenges, but was eventually figured out. 


Lily accomplished getting user input for choosing which game to play and various input types for during game 
	play. This also included randomizing a dice roll and card draw for games such as Sorry and Aggravation. 


There was some miscommunication as Lily thought Chase was creating boards similar to the Othello board, not a
	background board that looks fully realistic. However, the end result does look good, it just took much 
	longer to figure out the one single board and the other game boards were not done. 


Next week the plan is for Chase to take some time to explain to Lily how to easily use his chess board class
	and for Lily to explain to Chase how to use the input features. Chase will then start the process of 
	implementing Chess and Lily will do Checkers/King's Corner/Othello. The goal is not to fully finish 
	these games, but make significant progress. As we come across functions that seem like they can be 
	implemented amongst several games (such as keeping track of and printing scores), we will take the 
	time to make them their own classes. Depending on how many of these classes we end up making, this will
	delay completion of the specific games.
