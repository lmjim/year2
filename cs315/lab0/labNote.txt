Types of proofs:
1. Induction
2. Contradiction
3. Deduction

recursion
divide-and-conquer
dynamic programming

review HANOI problem and create algorithm
	use both recursion and divide-and-conquer
	HANOI(A,B,C,k)
		if k=1 
			move the top disk from A to C
		else 
			HANOI(A,C,B,k-1)
			move top disk from A to C
			HANOI(B,A,C,k-1)

1. base case
	true
2. inductive step
	k=2 to k=n-1
	assume true
3. prove k=n
